2. **In-Memory Storage**: Mock repository loses data on restart
3. **Error Messages**: Could be more descriptive for validation failures
4. **Documentation**: Some inline code documentation could be improved

### Future Considerations

1. **Performance**: No performance monitoring or optimization yet
2. **Security**: Basic security measures, could be enhanced
3. **Scalability**: Designed for scalability but not tested at scale
4. **Monitoring**: Basic health checks, needs comprehensive observability

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Confirmed)

- **Hono.js Framework**: Lightweight and modern, excellent choice
- **6-Layer Architecture**: Provides clear separation, working well
- **Zod Validation**: Type safety and runtime validation, very effective
- **External Authentication**: Reduces complexity, good architectural choice
- **Repository Pattern**: Enables flexibility, good for testing

### Refined Approaches

- **Error Handling**: Evolved to layered approach with domain-specific errors
- **Testing Strategy**: Refined to focus on layer isolation
- **Development Environment**: Enhanced with Docker integration
- **Type Safety**: Maximized with strict TypeScript and Zod integration

### Lessons Learned

1. **Schema-First Design**: Zod schemas as single source of truth works excellently
2. **Layer Isolation**: Strict boundaries make testing and maintenance easier
3. **Dependency Injection**: Manual injection provides simplicity and testability
4. **Development Tooling**: Investment in tooling pays off in productivity
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is essential for template success
