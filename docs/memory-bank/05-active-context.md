# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Status**: MongoDB Repository Implementation
**Date**: Jun 7, 2025
**Objective**: ðŸŽ¯ **IN PROGRESS** - Implement INoteRepository with MongoDB database integration

## Recent Changes

### âœ… Server-Sent Events Implementation Complete (June 2025)

**Implementation Status**: Fully Complete and Documented
**Documentation**: Comprehensive guide available in `docs/guides/server-sent-events.md`

**Key Achievements**:

- **Event System Architecture**: Central event emitter with TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation
- **BaseService Pattern**: Consistent event emission across all services with proper inheritance
- **SSE Endpoint**: Authenticated streaming with ReadableStream API and proper authorization filtering
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications for note CRUD operations with heartbeat and connection management
- **Educational Value**: Complete event-driven architecture demonstration for student learning

**Files Implemented**:

- `src/events/event-emitter.ts` - Central event system with ServiceEventType interface
- `src/events/base.service.ts` - Base service class with protected emitEvent method
- `src/schemas/event.schema.ts` - Event schemas with generic data field and resource typing
- `src/routes/events.router.ts` - SSE endpoint with ReadableStream and authorization integration
- `src/services/note.service.ts` - Enhanced with event emission after successful operations
- Comprehensive test suite with full coverage

**Architecture Implemented**:

```
User Action â†’ Service Layer â†’ Event Emission â†’ SSE Router â†’ Connected Clients
     â†“              â†“              â†“              â†“              â†“
Business Logic â†’ BaseService â†’ EventEmitter â†’ Authorization â†’ Real-time UI
```

**Key Technical Decisions**:

- **Generic Event Schema**: `data: z.unknown()` allows different entity types while maintaining type safety
- **ReadableStream API**: Modern streaming approach instead of Hono's deprecated stream() function
- **Resource-based Authorization**: Event filtering follows same rules as CRUD permissions
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup with heartbeat and disconnect handling

## Next Steps

### Current Priority - MongoDB Integration

1. **ðŸŽ¯ MongoDB Repository Implementation** (Current Focus)

   **Objective**: Replace mock repository with real MongoDB implementation to teach database persistence concepts

   **Implementation Plan**:

   - Create `src/repositories/mongodb/note.mongodb.repository.ts` implementing `INoteRepository`
   - Add MongoDB connection management and configuration
   - Implement proper data mapping between MongoDB documents and domain entities
   - Add MongoDB-specific error handling and validation
   - Update environment configuration for MongoDB connection
   - Create comprehensive test suite with test database

   **Files to Create/Modify**:

   - `src/repositories/mongodb/note.mongodb.repository.ts` - MongoDB implementation
   - `src/config/database.ts` - Database connection management
   - `src/env.ts` - Add MongoDB environment variables
   - `.env.example` - Document MongoDB configuration
   - `tests/repositories/note.mongodb.repository.test.ts` - Integration tests
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Add MongoDB service for development

   **Educational Goals**:

   - Demonstrate NoSQL database integration patterns
   - Teach document-based data modeling vs relational approaches
   - Show proper connection pooling and error handling
   - Illustrate data mapping between database and domain models

### Future Development Areas

1. **Additional Database Examples**: PostgreSQL implementation for SQL learning comparison
2. **Performance Features**: Redis caching integration for optimization concepts
3. **Additional Entity Examples**: User, Product entities following established patterns
4. **Advanced Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS for senior student learning
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows
6. **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and metrics integration

### Future Development Areas

1. **Additional Learning Examples**: User, Product, or other domain entities following Note pattern for student practice
2. **Database Integration**: Real database implementations (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to teach data persistence
3. **Performance Features**: Redis caching integration for teaching optimization concepts
4. **Advanced Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS, microservice communication for advanced courses
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows for DevOps learning
6. **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and metrics integration for production readiness education

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **6-Layer Architecture**: Proven effective for separation of concerns
- **Hono.js Framework**: Lightweight, modern, TypeScript-first
- **External Auth**: Delegated authentication reduces complexity
- **Schema-First Design**: Zod schemas as single source of truth
- **Repository Pattern**: Enables database technology flexibility

### Development Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Manual injection for simplicity and testability
- **Error Handling**: Layered approach with domain-specific errors
- **Validation Strategy**: Middleware-based with pre-validated data
- **Testing Approach**: Layer isolation with comprehensive mocking

### Technology Choices

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maximum type safety
- **ES Modules**: Modern module system
- **Vitest**: Better TypeScript support than Jest
- **Docker Development**: Consistent environment across student teams and eliminates "works on my machine" issues
- **pnpm**: Performance and disk efficiency benefits

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### File Organization

- **Feature-based**: Group by domain entity (Note, User, etc.)
- **Layer-based**: Clear separation within each feature
- **Naming Convention**: `entity-name.type.ts` pattern
- **Path Aliases**: Always use `@/` for imports

### Code Style

- **Explicit Imports**: Avoid barrel exports for clarity
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Type Inference**: Leverage Zod for automatic type generation
- **Error Boundaries**: Clear error handling at each layer

### Testing Philosophy

- **Layer Isolation**: Test each layer independently
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use interfaces for easy mocking
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ with focus on business logic
- **Test Organization**: Mirror source structure

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well

1. **Clear Architecture**: 6-layer pattern provides excellent separation
2. **Type Safety**: Zod + TypeScript combination catches errors early
3. **Development Experience**: Hot reload and debugging work seamlessly
4. **Testing Strategy**: Layer isolation makes tests focused and fast
5. **Docker Integration**: VS Code dev containers provide consistent environment

### Areas for Improvement (Educational Focus)

1. **Learning Documentation**: Could benefit from more inline code comments explaining concepts for students
2. **Entity Examples**: Additional entity examples would help students understand different data modeling patterns
3. **Error Messages**: More descriptive validation error messages to help students debug issues
4. **Performance Examples**: Could add Redis caching and performance monitoring to teach optimization
5. **Real-time Features**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - SSE implementation for teaching event-driven architecture
6. **Security Education**: Additional security headers and validation to teach security best practices

### Key Success Factors (Educational Perspective)

1. **Consistency**: Following established patterns across all features helps students learn by repetition
2. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript and Zod teaches students about compile-time safety and data validation
3. **Testability**: Architecture designed for easy testing teaches students good testing practices
4. **Learning Experience**: Tooling optimized for student productivity and learning progression
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documentation teaches professional development practices
