# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Status**: Memory Bank Initialization Complete
**Date**: May 28, 2025
**Objective**: Establishing comprehensive documentation foundation for the backend template project designed for student learning

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation

- **01-project-brief.md**: Established core project requirements, constraints, and success criteria
- **02-product-context.md**: Defined student-focused learning goals and educational problem-solution fit
- **03-system-patterns.md**: Documented 6-layer architecture and implementation patterns
- **04-tech-context.md**: Captured technology stack, development setup, and tooling
- **05-active-context.md**: Current state tracking (this file)
- **06-progress.md**: Initial progress documentation

### Project Understanding Gained

Through analysis of documentation and codebase, established understanding of:

- Complete Note entity implementation as reference pattern
- Layered architecture with strict separation of concerns
- Zod-first schema design with type inference
- Repository pattern with interface segregation
- External authentication service integration
- Comprehensive testing strategy with 90%+ coverage target

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Create progress.md**: Document current implementation status and remaining work
2. **Validate Memory Bank**: Ensure all core files are complete and accurate
3. **Identify Gaps**: Review for any missing context or patterns

### Future Development Areas

1. **Additional Learning Examples**: User, Product, or other domain entities following Note pattern for student practice
2. **Database Integration**: Real database implementations (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to teach data persistence
3. **Performance Features**: Redis caching integration for teaching optimization concepts
4. **Real-time Features**: SSE/WebSocket endpoints for teaching event-driven architecture
5. **Advanced Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS, microservice communication for advanced courses
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows for DevOps learning
7. **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and metrics integration for production readiness education

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **6-Layer Architecture**: Proven effective for separation of concerns
- **Hono.js Framework**: Lightweight, modern, TypeScript-first
- **External Auth**: Delegated authentication reduces complexity
- **Schema-First Design**: Zod schemas as single source of truth
- **Repository Pattern**: Enables database technology flexibility

### Development Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Manual injection for simplicity and testability
- **Error Handling**: Layered approach with domain-specific errors
- **Validation Strategy**: Middleware-based with pre-validated data
- **Testing Approach**: Layer isolation with comprehensive mocking

### Technology Choices

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maximum type safety
- **ES Modules**: Modern module system
- **Vitest**: Better TypeScript support than Jest
- **Docker Development**: Consistent environment across student teams and eliminates "works on my machine" issues
- **pnpm**: Performance and disk efficiency benefits

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### File Organization

- **Feature-based**: Group by domain entity (Note, User, etc.)
- **Layer-based**: Clear separation within each feature
- **Naming Convention**: `entity-name.type.ts` pattern
- **Path Aliases**: Always use `@/` for imports

### Code Style

- **Explicit Imports**: Avoid barrel exports for clarity
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Type Inference**: Leverage Zod for automatic type generation
- **Error Boundaries**: Clear error handling at each layer

### Testing Philosophy

- **Layer Isolation**: Test each layer independently
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use interfaces for easy mocking
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ with focus on business logic
- **Test Organization**: Mirror source structure

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well

1. **Clear Architecture**: 6-layer pattern provides excellent separation
2. **Type Safety**: Zod + TypeScript combination catches errors early
3. **Development Experience**: Hot reload and debugging work seamlessly
4. **Testing Strategy**: Layer isolation makes tests focused and fast
5. **Docker Integration**: VS Code dev containers provide consistent environment

### Areas for Improvement (Educational Focus)

1. **Learning Documentation**: Could benefit from more inline code comments explaining concepts for students
2. **Entity Examples**: Additional entity examples would help students understand different data modeling patterns
3. **Error Messages**: More descriptive validation error messages to help students debug issues
4. **Performance Examples**: Could add Redis caching and performance monitoring to teach optimization
5. **Real-time Features**: SSE/WebSocket examples to teach event-driven architecture
6. **Security Education**: Additional security headers and validation to teach security best practices

### Key Success Factors (Educational Perspective)

1. **Consistency**: Following established patterns across all features helps students learn by repetition
2. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript and Zod teaches students about compile-time safety and data validation
3. **Testability**: Architecture designed for easy testing teaches students good testing practices
4. **Learning Experience**: Tooling optimized for student productivity and learning progression
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documentation teaches professional development practices

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features

- **Note Entity**: Complete CRUD implementation across all layers
- **Authentication**: External service integration with middleware
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation throughout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error mapping
- **Testing**: Full test suite with high coverage
- **Development Environment**: Docker + VS Code integration
- **Build Pipeline**: Development and production builds

### Reference Implementation

The Note entity serves as the canonical example for:

- Schema definition and DTO generation
- Repository interface and mock implementation
- Service layer business logic and authorization
- Controller HTTP handling and error mapping
- Route definition and middleware application
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Educational Template Readiness

The project is ready to serve as a learning template for student backend development:

- Clear patterns established and documented for educational reference
- Development environment fully configured to eliminate setup barriers for students
- Testing infrastructure in place to teach proper testing practices
- Production deployment ready to teach deployment concepts
- Comprehensive documentation available for both students and educators

## Memory Bank Maintenance Notes

### Update Triggers

- When adding new entities or features
- After significant architectural changes
- When development patterns evolve
- After major dependency updates
- When deployment strategies change

### Key Files to Monitor

- **src/app.ts**: Main application configuration
- **src/schemas/**: Schema definitions and types
- **src/services/**: Business logic implementations
- **package.json**: Dependencies and scripts
- **docker-compose.yml**: Development environment

### Documentation Priorities

1. Keep `05-active-context.md` current with recent changes
2. Update `06-progress.md` when features are completed
3. Document new patterns in `03-system-patterns.md`
4. Update `04-tech-context.md` for technology changes
5. Maintain `02-product-context.md` for user experience insights
