# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Status**: Memory Bank Initialization Complete
**Date**: May 28, 2025
**Objective**: Establishing comprehensive documentation foundation for the backend template project

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation

- **01-project-brief.md**: Established core project requirements, constraints, and success criteria
- **02-product-context.md**: Defined user experience goals and problem-solution fit
- **03-system-patterns.md**: Documented 6-layer architecture and implementation patterns
- **04-tech-context.md**: Captured technology stack, development setup, and tooling
- **05-active-context.md**: Current state tracking (this file)
- **06-progress.md**: Initial progress documentation

### Project Understanding Gained

Through analysis of documentation and codebase, established understanding of:

- Complete Note entity implementation as reference pattern
- Layered architecture with strict separation of concerns
- Zod-first schema design with type inference
- Repository pattern with interface segregation
- External authentication service integration
- Comprehensive testing strategy with 90%+ coverage target

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Create progress.md**: Document current implementation status and remaining work
2. **Validate Memory Bank**: Ensure all core files are complete and accurate
3. **Identify Gaps**: Review for any missing context or patterns

### Future Development Areas

1. **Additional Entities**: User, Product, or other domain entities following Note pattern
2. **Database Integration**: Real database implementations (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
3. **Advanced Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS, microservice communication
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows
5. **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and metrics integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **6-Layer Architecture**: Proven effective for separation of concerns
- **Hono.js Framework**: Lightweight, modern, TypeScript-first
- **External Auth**: Delegated authentication reduces complexity
- **Schema-First Design**: Zod schemas as single source of truth
- **Repository Pattern**: Enables database technology flexibility

### Development Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Manual injection for simplicity and testability
- **Error Handling**: Layered approach with domain-specific errors
- **Validation Strategy**: Middleware-based with pre-validated data
- **Testing Approach**: Layer isolation with comprehensive mocking

### Technology Choices

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maximum type safety
- **ES Modules**: Modern module system
- **Vitest**: Better TypeScript support than Jest
- **Docker Development**: Consistent environment across team
- **pnpm**: Performance and disk efficiency benefits

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### File Organization

- **Feature-based**: Group by domain entity (Note, User, etc.)
- **Layer-based**: Clear separation within each feature
- **Naming Convention**: `entity-name.type.ts` pattern
- **Path Aliases**: Always use `@/` for imports

### Code Style

- **Explicit Imports**: Avoid barrel exports for clarity
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Type Inference**: Leverage Zod for automatic type generation
- **Error Boundaries**: Clear error handling at each layer

### Testing Philosophy

- **Layer Isolation**: Test each layer independently
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use interfaces for easy mocking
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ with focus on business logic
- **Test Organization**: Mirror source structure

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What Works Well

1. **Clear Architecture**: 6-layer pattern provides excellent separation
2. **Type Safety**: Zod + TypeScript combination catches errors early
3. **Development Experience**: Hot reload and debugging work seamlessly
4. **Testing Strategy**: Layer isolation makes tests focused and fast
5. **Docker Integration**: VS Code dev containers provide consistent environment

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Documentation**: Could benefit from more inline code documentation
2. **Examples**: Additional entity examples would help demonstrate patterns
3. **Error Messages**: More descriptive validation error messages
4. **Performance**: Could add performance monitoring and optimization
5. **Security**: Additional security headers and validation

### Key Success Factors

1. **Consistency**: Following established patterns across all features
2. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript and Zod for compile-time safety
3. **Testability**: Architecture designed for easy testing
4. **Developer Experience**: Tooling optimized for productivity
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documentation

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Features

- **Note Entity**: Complete CRUD implementation across all layers
- **Authentication**: External service integration with middleware
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation throughout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error mapping
- **Testing**: Full test suite with high coverage
- **Development Environment**: Docker + VS Code integration
- **Build Pipeline**: Development and production builds

### Reference Implementation

The Note entity serves as the canonical example for:

- Schema definition and DTO generation
- Repository interface and mock implementation
- Service layer business logic and authorization
- Controller HTTP handling and error mapping
- Route definition and middleware application
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Template Readiness

The project is ready to serve as a template for new backend services:

- Clear patterns established and documented
- Development environment fully configured
- Testing infrastructure in place
- Production deployment ready
- Comprehensive documentation available

## Memory Bank Maintenance Notes

### Update Triggers

- When adding new entities or features
- After significant architectural changes
- When development patterns evolve
- After major dependency updates
- When deployment strategies change

### Key Files to Monitor

- **src/app.ts**: Main application configuration
- **src/schemas/**: Schema definitions and types
- **src/services/**: Business logic implementations
- **package.json**: Dependencies and scripts
- **docker-compose.yml**: Development environment

### Documentation Priorities

1. Keep `05-active-context.md` current with recent changes
2. Update `06-progress.md` when features are completed
3. Document new patterns in `03-system-patterns.md`
4. Update `04-tech-context.md` for technology changes
5. Maintain `02-product-context.md` for user experience insights
