# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This backend template addresses the common challenge developers face when starting new TypeScript backend projects. Instead of repeatedly setting up the same foundational architecture, tooling, and patterns, this template provides a battle-tested starting point that embodies best practices and proven patterns.

## Problems It Solves

### For Individual Developers

- **Setup Time**: Eliminates hours of initial project configuration
- **Architecture Decisions**: Provides proven layered architecture patterns
- **Tooling Integration**: Pre-configured development environment with debugging, testing, and code quality tools
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrates proper separation of concerns, error handling, and testing strategies

### For Development Teams

- **Consistency**: Ensures all team members start with the same architectural foundation
- **Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the project structure
- **Standards**: Enforces coding standards through automated tooling
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth from simple APIs to complex services

### For Organizations

- **Time to Market**: Faster project initialization and development cycles
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and code quality measures
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain
- **Security**: Proper authentication/authorization patterns from the start

## How It Should Work

### Developer Experience

1. **Quick Start**: Clone template → Copy .env → Run single command → Working API
2. **Development Flow**: Hot reload, debugging, and testing work seamlessly
3. **Code Quality**: Automatic formatting and linting on save
4. **Testing**: Easy test writing with comprehensive mocking support

### Architecture Flow

1. **Request Handling**: HTTP requests flow through middleware → routes → controllers
2. **Business Logic**: Controllers delegate to services for business operations
3. **Data Access**: Services use repositories for data persistence
4. **Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity at all layers
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints

### Deployment Experience

1. **Local Development**: Docker containers provide consistent environment
2. **Production Build**: Optimized builds with minimal dependencies
3. **Monitoring**: Health checks and proper error logging
4. **Scalability**: Stateless design supports horizontal scaling

## User Experience Goals

### For Template Users (Developers)

- **Immediate Productivity**: Start building features within minutes, not hours
- **Clear Patterns**: Obvious where to add new features following established patterns
- **Confidence**: Comprehensive tests provide confidence in changes
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify or extend without breaking existing functionality

### For API Consumers

- **Reliability**: Consistent error handling and response formats
- **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Efficient request processing and response times
- **Documentation**: Clear API contracts through schema validation

## Success Metrics

### Development Efficiency

- Time from clone to first API call: < 5 minutes
- Time to add new entity with full CRUD: < 30 minutes
- Test coverage maintained above 90%
- Zero configuration required for basic development

### Code Quality

- All code passes linting without warnings
- Consistent formatting across all files
- Type safety enforced throughout application
- Clear separation between layers

### Maintainability

- New developers can understand structure within 1 hour
- Adding new features follows obvious patterns
- Changes in one layer don't break others
- Comprehensive test coverage catches regressions

## Key Differentiators

### Compared to Starting from Scratch

- **Architecture**: Pre-designed layered architecture vs ad-hoc structure
- **Tooling**: Fully configured development environment vs manual setup
- **Patterns**: Established patterns vs learning through trial and error
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test setup vs afterthought testing

### Compared to Other Templates

- **Hono.js Focus**: Modern, lightweight framework vs heavier alternatives
- **Layer Separation**: Strict architectural boundaries vs mixed concerns
- **Development Experience**: VS Code + Docker integration vs basic setup
- **Production Ready**: Multi-stage Docker builds vs development-only configs

## Future Vision

This template should evolve to become the go-to starting point for TypeScript backend services, with:

- Additional entity examples (User, Product, etc.)
- Database integration examples (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Advanced patterns (event sourcing, CQRS)
- Microservice communication patterns
- Observability and monitoring integration
- CI/CD pipeline examples
